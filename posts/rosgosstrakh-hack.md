after taking a two month long hiatus (for mental health reasons, nothing to get into deeper here), i decided catch up again with some sources a few weeks ago. one of them started bringing up some massive hacks they had been doing in russia, making it clear they had financial motivations and planned on selling the data rather than leaking it publicly. this of course immediately piqued my interest and i tried to find a way to make a story happen anyways and after a bit of discussion we ended up striking a deal, i get exclusive access to the data for this piece but won't share it any further and they still get to sell it.

## the target

[rosgosstrakh (RGSL/росгосстрах)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosgosstrakh) is the second biggest russian insurance company, behind [SOGAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogaz) with an annual revenue of around 90 billion rubles ([2022](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/rgss.mm/financials/income-annual)). RGSL has been [subject to US sanctions](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/intelligence/new-sanctions-top-ten-russian-financial-institutions-now-under-u-s-restrictions/) since the start of the russian invasion of ukraine in february 2022. my source gained full access to their investment and life insurance department with data going back to 2010, giving them full access to ~3 million bank statements, data on 730k people/holders (around 80k of which with SNILS (russian ssn) and another 45k with full bank routing info), and all life insurance policies/contracts. they are also able to access all attachments to the former data, such as passports and scanned documents (i was only provided with a small selection of this data, but all of it is included in the purchasable dataset). the source further claims that they most likely have the ability to authorize and create bank transfers if they wanted to do so.

## analysis

![a screenshot of a json file containing some of the data on Anatoly Alexandrovich Safronov](/img/posts/rosgosstrakh-hack/json.jpg)

with access to an overwhelming 22gbs of plain json data i did what i always do when i get big datasets like this and first try to find interesting organizations or persons. in this case this was especially easy - public officials (or their direct relatives/spouses) are marked with `"isPublicOfficial": true`, making them super quick to find. i did this (and all my other searches) the lazy way, just searching over the directory with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) rather than indexing the data to a database, but it worked, finding a number of customers marked as public officials (it is highly likely there are way more officials in the dataset left unmarked due to how RGS's system is designed). it was now just a matter of using [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) to link the provided data to existing people. the table below includes everyone out of those i was conclusively able to identify, with the data from this dataset and any publicly findable info to complete the picture.

i think it's quite interesting how even with so few people found we actually got some pretty big fish. i am publishing all their info publicly here in hopes of this being even more useful for other investigative journalists and researchers looking into russian government officials. this was quite a fun excersise in some more OSINT as well as my ability to decipher cyrillic :3.

let's get to some even meatier people. using the [molfar list of GRU operatives](https://molfar.com/en/gru) i searched the dataset by passport numbers, and BAAM, here we have 3 GRU agents of them:

| id | name | name (transliterated) | birth date | function |  sanctioned | phone number | email | passport number | documents | insurance coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 498871 | Федосеев Алексей Константинович | Fedoseyev Alexey Konstantinovich | 1986-02-24 | unknown (posted at Siemens LLC according to Molfar) | no | - | - | 4508335107 | - | life insurance with ~1mil rub coverage,<br> beneficiary is AO UniCredit Bank |
| 479186 | Аверин Валерий Владимирович | Averin Valery Vladimirovich | 1980-03-05 | unknown (posted at Orgmarket LLC according to Molfar) | no | +7 (916) 221 53 91 | walerius@inbox.ru |  4504934427  | - | had life insurance with ~1.2mil rub coverage until 2018,<br> beneficiary was AO UniCredit Bank |
| 283673 | Фомивко Александр Федорович | Fomivko Alexander Fyodorovich | 1987-07-14 | unknown | no | +7 (985) 361 79 71 | old.atlas@yandex.ru |  0706926325 | - | has life insurance with ~2.3mil rub coverage since february 2023 |

there were unfortunately no attached documents for all three of them.

i didn't get much useful info out of contact details in this rather surface-level analysis and didn't yet have the time for a deeper dive, but i might do a follow up to this piece with some more analysis particularly of that data. however i decided to finally give [QGIS](https://qgis.org) a quick go and try to map out where customers are located, but even with just the 85k addresses that contain coordinates (just to see if geocoding the rest would be worth it) it already pretty much turned into a population map of russia, [which is of course already an xkcd punchline](https://xkcd.com/1138/). im still gonna put it here though because there still is a few small interesting takeaways.

![a map of russia with various dots on it showing where RGSL customers are located. the dots mostly line up with highly populated areas in russia](/img/posts/rosgosstrakh-hack/map.jpg)

as expected the customers are mostly spread out across the highly populated areas in south-western russia, but what's interesting is the not insignificant number of customers in crimea and the small number of customers in occupied mainland ukraine. i will probably also take a bit more of a look at some of those for a future update.

as the [sale thread](https://breachforums.is/Thread-Rosgosstrakh-700K-Customers-400GB) states my source attempted to negotiate with RGSL, but did not come to any agreement with them, meaning the dataset is now up for sale with an asking price of 50k usd in xmr. i reached out to RGSL for comment as i published this and will update if i hear anything back. as always feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any other data to publish or cover, have any fun vulns, or for journalistic inquiries.
