earlier this year, [the popular far right fediverse instance poast was hacked](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/leak-poast-kiwi-farms/) leaking user profiles with emails, posts and DMs. today i was sent a special little treat, [a singular html file](/files/posts/meet-the-shitpoasters/meet-the-shitpoasters.html) containing all the poa.st and bae.st profiles with linkedin profiles associated to their e-mail addresses, all their linkedin info, their top 5 worst posts as ranked by sentiment analysis and their DMs. i will leave proper in depth analysis of this data to extremism researchers and journalists, but a few interesting people i can find at a glance are:

- the developer of rtorrent
- at least 4 google employees
- at least 1 amazon employee
- at least 1 microsoft employee
- at least 1 apple employee
- the CISO of tezos foundation
- numerous people in the US military
- ~~a self proclaimed "national socialist" who's a professor at gardner-webb university~~
- just sooo many people in the tech industry

## correction

after some feedback regarding potential false positives in the list, the source of the compiled document asked me to publish the following correction: "Upon further research, Richard (Shawn) Carmichael aka psychosis67 is not a professor at Gardner-Webb University, but an IT guy from Humboldt, Iowa who impersonated the university professor from North Carolina with the same name on his now deleted LinkedIn profile.", a formal apology has been sent to the professor. furthermore we found that user bluj162 was also mapped wrong (to the chief operating officer of a school district), research here however shows that bluj162 is the son of J. Sanchez of Palm Beach (who i presume managed his dads LinkedIn?).
